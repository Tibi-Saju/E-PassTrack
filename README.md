# E-PassTrack
An advanced E-pass management system to help users create one pass to travel all India and manage them later.

Advanced E-pass Management System is a web-based technology for providing e-passes to the users to travel from one state to another through online. This system was intended to perform functionalities like accessing basic information about the users making travel to other states with verification and provide e-passes to the users without making them wait for a long time. This system is helpful to users to get e-pass from anywhere in the state. 

It is also used to manage the e-passes of various logged in users and used as future references. Generating the pass is easy and simple in this portal by just providing the personal details of the travellers. It also keeps the record of the travellers travelling from and to and the number of days of stay.

Unlike the existing systems, E-PassTrack has two dashboards- one managed by Admin and another managed by users. Admin dashboard manages all the activities of user account which includes updating user and epass details. Once the user registers to the system, he/she owns a seperate dashboard where they can search and view previously generated epasses. In case the user lose the epass, he/she can always login to their account and download the epass anytime. User dashboard also includes latest news and guidelines provided by the government for user's knowledge. 

One time registration is only required and later they can make any number of travels by simply entering details of the journey. The information is stored in the database securely.
